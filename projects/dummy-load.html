    <h3 class="status-completed">Dummy Load</h3>
    <p>
      I wanted a simple dry dummy load for testing and to tinker that's capable to take a decent amount of power from the transmitter.
      This was a quick little evening project once I picked out and received the parts.

	  <h4>Parts:</h4>
	  <ul>
	    <li>Heatsink Wakefield 423K 140x120x67mm</li>
		<li>50 Ohm 250N50 Resistor</li>
		<li>Type N Female Panel Mount</li>
		<li>Thermal Paste</li>
		<li>3x screws and nuts</li>
	  </ul>
	  Total cost was about $47 dollars for <u>two</u> dummy load. I only build one so far. The heatsink is the most expensive part by far.
	</p>

	  <h4>Construction:</h4>
      The construction was quite easy.  I opted to share a screw with the resistor and coax connector for simplicity and 
      ease of ground connection.<br />

	  <h4>Results:</h4>
      The SWR of the dummy load is perfect for HF and quite good for higher frequencies.<br />

	  <br />
	  So far I have used the dummy load with a Boafeng on 2m and 70cm using 5W and Icom 7300 at 30% power using SSB on 20m band.  I haven't
	  noticed any increased temperature of the resistor.

	  <h4>Potential enhancement:</h4>
	  <ul>
	    <li>Adding a wattmeter circuit would be nice.</li>
		<li>RF shielding on the bottom</li>
	  </ul>
