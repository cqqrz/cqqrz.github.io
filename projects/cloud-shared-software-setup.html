    <p>
      I share my amateur radio equipment with my spouse and maybe in the future
      with some of our children that still live with us. Our computers are also
      shared.  However, we want to be able to log our contacts separately and
      software like fldigi are specifically customized to the operator.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most software don't easily support multiple user out of the box.  Also,
      while we mainly use MS Windows, we don't utelize seperate user accouts.
      Instead we use a single shared family account.  Besides the amateur radio
      software, it make our life quite a bit simpler.
    </p>
    <p>
      So a plan was in order to make things work for us.  Let's sum up the goals.

      <dt>Desired outcome:</dt>
      <ul>
        <li>Allow multiple amateur operators to use their call sign to operate and
            and log their work.</li>

        <li>Simple logging</li>
        <li>Ability to work digital modes</li>
        <li>Rig control</li>
      </ul>
      <dt>Software:</dt>
