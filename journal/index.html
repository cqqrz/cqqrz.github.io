      <dt> <span class="deemphasize">June 25, 2017:</span> ARRL Field Day </dt>
      <dd> I was the Gota (GET On The Air) station chair.  As a newly licensed ham I also got to
	    make contacts myself with that station, although I had to wait till night as we had plenty
	    of other people on the station.  I made about 100 QSOs, mostly PSK31 since I was next to 
		our phone station.  Phone is more fun but also harder and slower than digital.  On top of 
		that it gets less points if you chase scores.  I thought I was capped at a 100 QSOs but
		it's just that bonus points aren't awarded after that.  No regrets thought, I needed to gets
		some sleep sometime.
		<br>
		Field Day was great.  I got to experience the difficulties of running multiple station at 
		close proximity, see the benefit of band pass filters, get some awsome dutch oven cooking,
		and get to camp with the family.

      <dt> <span class="deemphasize">May 12, 2017:</span> First Portable Operation </dt>
      <dd> Over lunch hour I went to a local park to test out the new to me Yaesu FT-857D
        as a portable station on the 10 meter band.  I set up a home made dipole vertically
        with the help of a kite pole and bicycle repair stand.  My wife was at home on the
        Icom IC-7300 and a horizontal dipole.
        <br>
        First contact was on 29.600 Mhz, the FM simplex calling frequency. The strange thing
        was that after my wife was done talking there was another voice transmission. That
        happend several times and finally I heard a call sign and decided to talk directly
        with him.  As it turned out I could hear that third station but, most likely because
        of antenna poliarzation, my wife didn't hear that station.  It was pretty neat to hear
        another station on 10m since so far I haven't heard any activity on that band.
        <br>
        We played around a bit more on the band.  Trying out different modes (AM, SSB) and
        see how low power we could go before loosing any quality with FM (about 5 watts).
        My lunch hour exploration barely made a dent into the jump start battery that I was
        using.

      <dt> <span class="deemphasize">April 30, 2017:</span> Cook Islands </dt>
      <dd> Today I heard 51 in a call sign that was calling CQ on 20m. I was
        wondering why he’s saying two numbers since our call sign format only allows
        for one number. Finally I realized that it’s not an US call sign. I made
        contact with that station in Cook Islands which is 6,000 miles from me.
        My distance record so far.
        <br />
        When I told my daughter about this she was extremely excited, especially
        since earlier today she build the 20m dipole I was using.

      <dt> <span class="deemphasize">April 16, 2017:</span> SSB Rookie Roundup</dt>
      <dd> This was my first contest that I really participated.  Before that I did
        answer a few CQs that were contesting and even submitted the contacts to
        MOQP and MSQP.  Since my wife also just got her general class license we
        had to share our radio during the Rookie Roundup.  The band were quite
        staticy and we had to work quite hard for our contacts.  Luckily I got the
        last few minutes and caught up and passed her. She had 16 contacts and I got
        20.  Both of us made our first "international" contact with stations in
        Canada.  My confirmed QSL with Alaska (2,600 miles) was pretty awsome,
        although it took a lot of patience to make it happen.
