      <dt> <span class="deemphasize">January 21, 2018:</span> Winter tinkering</dt>
      <dd>
        Ad-hoc antennas don't quite work in the middle of the winter here in Iowa.  Having
	the sliding patio door open to run the coax is just not advisable with some of the 
	temperatures we had.  So I've been quite inactive on HF.  I also came to the conclusion
	that I need to drill a hole into the wall if I want to operate year round.
	      
	So some plans will be coming up on a bit more permanent station installation.  I really
	don't have a clue yet what that means in regards to antennas.
	      
	I did stay active in the hobby tinkering with the aprs igate and an arduino tnc for 
	transmitting aprs packages.  I also installed a permanent HF stick antenna mount on 
	my vehicle.  More to come on that later, after I had some experience using it.

      <dt> <span class="deemphasize">September 1, 2017:</span> New callsign</dt>
      <dd>
        Having passed the extra class test I started looking at vanity calls.  The major
        was to get a call sign that I could easily say without misunderstandings.  Another
        aspect was the cw weight as I'm hoping to learn morse code and get to operate
        cw sometime.  Getting a 1x2 or 2x1 call sign is quite hard. Supprisingly
        the 1x3 callsign that I adopted (K0TET) is quite low in cw weight and
        tango-echo-tango rolls quite nicely off the toung.  Hopefully this call
        sign works out.  You can't really test callsigns on the air until you get it
        (i.e. I probably shouldn't ID with a fake call sign).

      <dt> <span class="deemphasize">August 20, 2017:</span> Net control</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>With the upcoming eclipse the scheduled net control operator was out of town
          and nobody else has volunteered to run the local net on the 2m repeater.  I
          took the opportunity to try my hand with it, called out if we had a net control and
          if not volunteered myself.</p>
        <p>The tricky parts for me was to log everybody's call sign as I haven't really
          burned any of them into my brain.  The other thing is that I'm way to much on HF
          and am used to the international radiotelephony alphabet.  On top of that I wasn't
          expecting 13 check ins.</p>
        <p>Running the net turned out not to difficult since I could follow the published
          script and read of some of the upcoming events. Hardest part would have been accepting
          formal traffic like an ARRL radiogramm and routing it appropriately.  Luckely there
          was no formal traffic. </p>
        <p>I enjoyed having had this experience.  The next thing I'll have to do sometime is
          to send send an radiogram to somebody but I haven't figured out to whom.  I did receive
          a radiogram already after I passed my technician and general tests while I checked into
          the net of the neighboring town.  That was a supprise and pretty awsome.</p>

      <dt> <span class="deemphasize">August 13, 2017:</span> North American QSO Party SSB </dt>
      <dd>
        <p>I participated in the North American QSO Party.  It was a lot of fun.  I mostly did
        search and pounce since the few times I called CQ didn't get me much results.  The
        antenna setup was field day style with th2 20m hanging low between the house and a tree
        and the 40m being a inverted V with the clothesline antenna and the 35ft fiberglass
        military mast.  I totaled 92 QSOs including Chile on 20m and Hawaii both on 20 and 40m.</p>

        <p>Of course my call sign (KE0LMQ) was challenging as usual but worse off is my first name
        which is part of the exchange.  I tried to spell it whenever possible but still I wonder
        how many people logged it incorrectly and how many QSOs will be disqualified because of
        it.  Next phone contest I'll choose an easier name like Ed or Sam.</p>

        <p>The contest wore me out quite a bit though so I skipped the RTTY Rookie Roundup.  My
        wife did that contest but as usual with the Rookie Roundups it was not a very happening
        event.  She did get a station in Hawaii as well though.</p>

      <dt> <span class="deemphasize">August 13, 2017:</span> Amateur Extra </dt>
      <dd>
        <p>Yesterday my wife and I passed the Amateur Extra test.  To celebrate we participated
        in the local club's fox hunt and attended the club potluck.  It was tricky to get a
        signal of the fox at all but eventually we did hear the fox and found it fairly quickly.</p>

        <p>Since I'm having trouble communicating my callsign KE0LMQ, Quebec is a hard one for me
        to pronounce and for some strange reason the Lima gets lost sometimes.  After looking
        at available callsigns I decided to apply for K0TET with the hopes that my pronunciation
        of that call is better and it will be a good CW call sign.  It turned out that this
        technician eligible callsign is has a lower cw weight that quite a few of the shorter
        amateur extra call signs.</p>

        <p>Yes the next challenge is to learn cw.</p>

      <dt> <span class="deemphasize">June 25, 2017:</span> ARRL Field Day </dt>
      <dd>
        <p>I was the Gota (GET On The Air) station chair.  As a newly licensed ham I also got to
	      make contacts myself with that station, although I had to wait till night as we had plenty
  	    of other people on the station.  I made about 100 QSOs, mostly PSK31 since I was next to
        our phone station.  Phone is more fun but also harder and slower than digital.  On top of
        that it gets less points if you chase scores.  I thought I was capped at a 100 QSOs but
        it's just that bonus points aren't awarded after that.  No regrets thought, I needed to gets
        some sleep sometime.</p>

        <p>Field Day was great.  I got to experience the difficulties of running multiple station at
        close proximity, see the benefit of band pass filters, get some awsome dutch oven cooking,
        and get to camp with the family.</p>
      </dd>

      <dt> <span class="deemphasize">May 12, 2017:</span> First Portable Operation </dt>
      <dd>
        <p>Over lunch hour I went to a local park to test out the new to me Yaesu FT-857D
        as a portable station on the 10 meter band.  I set up a home made dipole vertically
        with the help of a kite pole and bicycle repair stand.  My wife was at home on the
        Icom IC-7300 and a horizontal dipole.</p>

        <p>First contact was on 29.600 Mhz, the FM simplex calling frequency. The strange thing
        was that after my wife was done talking there was another voice transmission. That
        happend several times and finally I heard a call sign and decided to talk directly
        with him.  As it turned out I could hear that third station but, most likely because
        of antenna poliarzation, my wife didn't hear that station.  It was pretty neat to hear
        another station on 10m since so far I haven't heard any activity on that band.</p>

        <p>We played around a bit more on the band.  Trying out different modes (AM, SSB) and
        see how low power we could go before loosing any quality with FM (about 5 watts).
        My lunch hour exploration barely made a dent into the jump start battery that I was
        using.</p>

      <dt> <span class="deemphasize">April 30, 2017:</span> Cook Islands </dt>
      <dd>
        <p>Today I heard 51 in a call sign that was calling CQ on 20m. I was
        wondering why he’s saying two numbers since our call sign format only allows
        for one number. Finally I realized that it’s not an US call sign. I made
        contact with that station in Cook Islands which is 6,000 miles from me.
        My distance record so far.</p>

        <p>When I told my daughter about this she was extremely excited, especially
        since earlier today she build the 20m dipole I was using.</p>

      <dt> <span class="deemphasize">April 16, 2017:</span> SSB Rookie Roundup</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>This was my first contest that I really participated.  Before that I did
        answer a few CQs that were contesting and even submitted the contacts to
        MOQP and MSQP.  Since my wife also just got her general class license we
        had to share our radio during the Rookie Roundup.  The band were quite
        staticy and we had to work quite hard for our contacts.  Luckily I got the
        last few minutes and caught up and passed her. She had 16 contacts and I got
        20.  Both of us made our first "international" contact with stations in
        Canada.  My confirmed QSL with Alaska (2,600 miles) was pretty awsome,
        although it took a lot of patience to make it happen.</p>
