      <dt> April 30, 2015: Cook Islands </dt>
      <dd> Today I heard 51 in a call sign that was calling CQ on 20m. I was
        wondering why he’s saying two numbers since our call sign format only allows
        for one number. Finally I realized that it’s not an US call sign. I made
        contact with that station in Cook Islands which is 6,000 miles from me.
        <br />
        When I told my daughter about this she was extremely excited, especially
        since she build the 20m dipole I was using just today.

      <dt> April 16, 2017: SSB Rookie Roundup</dt>
      <dd> This was my first contest that I really participated.  Before that I did
        answer a few CQs that were contesting and even submitted the contacts to
        MOQP and MSQP.  Since my wife also just got her general class license we
        had to share our radio during the Rookie Roundup.  The band were quite
        staticy and we had to work quite hard for our contacts.  Luckily I got the
        last few minutes and caught up and passed her. She had 16 contacts and I got
        20.  Both of us made our first "international" contact with stations in
        Canada.  My confirmed QSL with Alaska (2,600 miles) was pretty awsome,
        although it took a lot of patience to make it happen.
