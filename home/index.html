      <p>Currently I'm playing around with our temporary 25' military mast that hold the 40m, 20m and by pure accident 17m and 8m dipole antennas.  Doing occasionally some SSB, PSK32 and JT65 calls.</p>

      <p>For <b>Field Day</b> I will be the GOTA (Get On The Air) station chair, which means I'm in charge of getting that station setup for the Story County Amateur Radio Club. Since I got my license for X-mas I'm eligible to make contacts myself as well.  However, I hope we have plenty of visitors who are willing to try their luck.  I'm planning to run both voice (phone) and some digital modes if people are interested.  My wife might also try her newly acquired morse (cw) skills.</p>

      <p>So if you are around please visit us at the <a target="_blank"href="https://goo.gl/maps/TVo9pdJogkA2">Snow Bunting Lodge at Hickory Grove Park</a> in Iowa.  Or visit one of the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.arrl.org/field-day-locator">other Field Day station</a> and give us a call.  We'll be calling under W0YL for our main station and [to be determined] for the GOTA station.</p>
