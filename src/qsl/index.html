    <h3>QSL</h3>
    <p>
      I upload logs to LOTW.<br />
      <i>(logs may take 24h to be uploaded)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
     Let me know if you want an QSL card, as I don't mail them by default.

	    Special card for my first DX contact.  My daughter is pointing out the 20m dipole antenna she build with me.
		That evening I talked (phone) to E51DLD from Cook Islands with it.  Pretty awesome.

	    For my initial callsign KE0LMQ I asked my daughter to draw a picture for my QSL card.  I guess she was a bit inspired
		by the first one. *smile*<br />

	    I still need to design a QSL card for my new callsign.  As soon as I have one design and printed I'll send them out.
