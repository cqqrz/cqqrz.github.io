    <h3>QSL</h3>
    <p>
      I upload logs to LOTW.<br />
      <i>(logs may take 24h to be uploaded)</i>

    <p>
     Let me know if you want an QSL card, as I don't mail them by default.

	    Special card for my first DX contact.  My daughter is pointing out the 20m dipole antenna she build with me.
		That evening I talked (phone) to E51DLD from Cook Islands with it.  Pretty awesome.

	    For my initial callsign KE0LMQ I asked my daughter to draw a picture for my QSL card.  I guess she was a bit inspired
		by the first one. *smile*<br />

	    I waited way to long to get the perfect design and finally just got this batch of cards made. Again, going with the theme 
		of dipoles and the neverending desire to get a better antenna.<br />
