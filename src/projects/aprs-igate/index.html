    <h3 class="status-completed">APRS iGate</h3>
    <p>
      The APRS iGate is a Rasperry Pi with an RTL-SDR.com dongle.  I started out with a Rasperry Pi image 
      which just required minimal configurations to get up and running. (<a href="http://qso365.co.uk/2017/02/setting-up-an-aprs-rx-only-igate-using-a-raspberry-pi-and-a-pre-built-image/">http://qso365.co.uk/2017/02/setting-up-an-aprs-rx-only-igate-using-a-raspberry-pi-and-a-pre-built-image/</a>)

      With switching from a Rasperry Pi 3 to a Rasperry Pi 2 I needed to recompile the direwolf code 
      (<a href="https://github.com/wb2osz/direwolf">https://github.com/wb2osz/direwolf</a>).  
      I also run the Rasperry Pi in console mode instead of GUI to save a few cpu cycles.  
      Using GNU screen I can still attach remotely and view the direwolf output.

      The iGate is located on the second story crammed behind a closet.  The antenna, especially the ground plane 
      which is a metal tape measure piece, isn't the best.  So it doesn't hear as much traffic as some of the neighboring
      digipeaters. The APRS iGate still runs experimental as 
      <a href="https://aprs.fi/info/a/K0TET-10">K0TET-10</a>.  I'm not sure if I'll keep it running permanently.
