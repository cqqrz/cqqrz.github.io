	          Manufacturer: Transco
			  Part Number: 919C70100
			  
			  This is an SMA antenna switch. The configuration is single pole, double throw (SPDT) where IN and 1 are closed when no power is applied and IN and 2 are closed when power is applied.  
			  It's marked for 28V DC operation.  When I tested the switch at 28V it had a current draw of 80mA.  The switch operates fine with 24V DC and draws 70mA. I wouldn't go lower than that.
			  12V will not operate the switch.  The switch does generate some heat and gets warm to the touch.
