    <h3 class="status-active">TYT TH-8600 Tips and Hints</h3>
    <p>
      There doesn't seem to be a good place for documentation, tips and hints for the TYT TH-8600 amateur radio.
	  This page is my attempt to put together all the information about this radio.

      <dt>Frequency Unlocking</dt>
      <dd>
	    <p>Apparently TYT locks new radios sold in the USA to 150-160MHz VHF and 450-460MHz UHF. 
		In order to use them for the amatuer radio services the transceiver needs to be unlocked.
		My unit was used and already setup for the ham bands so I haven't verified the unlocking 
		procedure myself.</p>
		<p>To unlock make sure that the TH-8600 is turned off. Hold the "LO" (top left) button and 
		   the "A/B" (bottom right) button while turning the TH-8600 on.</p>

	    <p>The TYT provides several downloads for the TH-8600 at <a href="http://www.tyt888.com/?mod=download">http://www.tyt888.com/?mod=download</a>,
        however there isn't much description to what these downloads are.  Here's my take on these files.  The date is the date and title match that on
        the download page.</b>
		<ul>
		  <li><b>2019-01-07 TH-8600 FOR USA</b>
            <p>Contains the "TH-8600_20171206 .exe" which is the "V1.5" version of the programming software.  The 
            installation program needs to run as administrator. [Yes, that's not good practice].  After install, the
            local user can be granted write access to the installation directory of the programming software.  This
            allows regular users to use the software and makes things a little less bad.</p>
            <p>Installing the programming software also places the Prolific USB driver installed in that directory.
            I did not thest this driver since I already had a Prolific USB driver installed.</p>

            <p>The download also contains the "Th8600_UpdataFile2018_12_07_2_20JT.icf" firmware and the installer program "TH-8600_UpData.exe" in the
            "Update File" directory.  I'm not sure what updates this firmware contains and I haven't had the guts to install it yet. If you have more
            info please let me know.</p>

		  <li><b>2018-10-16 TH-8600 LCD software</b>
		    <p>This is a little utility to determine and set the LCD display type.  Apparently there are three different 
		    types of LCDs.</p>
		    <img src="tyt-th-8600-lcd-select.jpg" alt="TYT TH-8600 LCD Software" />
            <p> To use this utility choose the COM port in "Settings" -> "ComPort Select". Then click the "Read LCD" button.
		    At this point the message "TETS MOD" is displayed on the LCD of the TH-8600. The drop down list will have the 
		    LCD type listed that is currently being used. Select other LCD types via the drop down list as desired.  Click 
		    the "Exit Test" button to finalize the selection and close the connection.</p>
		    <img src="tyt-th-8600-lcd-1.jpg" alt="TYT TH-8600 in LCD 1 mode" />
		    <img src="tyt-th-8600-lcd-2.jpg" alt="TYT TH-8600 in LCD 2 mode" />
		    <img src="tyt-th-8600-lcd-3.jpg" alt="TYT TH-8600 in LCD 3 mode" />
		    <p> My tranceiver uses the "LCD 3". "LCD 1" is upside down and "LCD 2" is mirrored for me.  I guess this 
		    feature allows for some interesting customizations or projects with the radio.</p>
