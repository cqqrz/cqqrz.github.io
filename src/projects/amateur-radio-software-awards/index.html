    <h3 class="status-active">Amateur Radio Software Award</h3>
    <p>
      I'm starting an Amateur Radio Software award in order to promote amateur radio software development 
	  which adheres to the same spirit as amateur radio itself: innovative, free and open.
    </p>
    <p>
	  The award will constist of a PDF certificate, a monetary prize $100+, and listing on the awards website.
    </p>
	<p>
	  The award committee will choose the award winner by their discression.  Others may join the award committee.
      Each award committee members is required to provide $100 which is used for the award money.  Once the award
	  money exceeds $500 the committee may choose to award multiple awards in a year.
	</p>
	<p>
	  At this point no organization is being setup to manage the awards. In the future one may be established.
	  But for now things are kept simple.
	</p>

	  <ul>
	    <li>Create award rules.  Done, see <a href="award.html">draft</a>.</li>
