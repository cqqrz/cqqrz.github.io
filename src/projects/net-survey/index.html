    <h3 class="status-active">Net Survey</h3>
    <p>
      I'm keeping track of the various amateur radio nets that I can reach from my home location.  Noted 
      are the minimum equipment needed for a successful check-in.

    <p>
      <dt>Story County ARES Net - 147.240 +0.6 MHz - Sundays 7:00pm - FM Repeater 5.84 miles</dt>
      <dd>Stock Baofeng (5W and rubber ducky). I occasionally check in here as it's our local club's weekly net.</dd>
      <dt>Boone County ARES Net - 146.850 -0.6 MHz - Sundays 8:00pm - FM Repeater 10.14 miles</dt>
      <dd>Baofeng (5W) with 3 element tape measure yagi on indoors second floor. I occasionally check in here.  The Boone net seems to have 
      more formal traffic than the Story County net.  I got even received a formal traffic congratulating me on passing the test when I 
      first got licensed and was checking into this net.  This was pretty cool.</dd>
      <dt>Boone County ARES Net - 443.900 +5 MHz - Sundays 8:15pm - FM Repeater 10.14 miles</dt>
      <dd>Baofeng (5W) with 3 element tape measure yagi on indoors second floor.  Slightly worse than the 2m net.</dd>
      <dt>Iowa 160 Meter Ares Net - 1.9725 MHz - Sundays 9:30pm - SSB</dt>
      <dd>W0FS was the net control with about 21 miles from me.  Used random wire with the Icom AT-130 tuner.  Only one other station checked in that I barely could make out.</dd>
