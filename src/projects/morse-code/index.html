    <h3 class="status-active">Morse Code</h3>
	<p>
	  Morse code is the ultimate mode of amateur radio operation.  It's not only nostalgic but does still provides multiple advantages in today, especially on HF bands.  
      So it's easy to see why being able to do QSOs in Morse is a goal of mine.  Not an easy goal since I'm neither musically inclined nor do learn foreign
      languages and multiplication tables easily.  So I'm in for the long term to slowly improve my Morse code copying skills.

      I started seriously learning Morse code with the Spring 2018 CW Academy Level 1 course.  While I do have some confirmed CW QSLs, primarily thanks to the slow 
      speed CW Ops contest, they relied to heavily on the help of my wife or computer to copy the received Morse code.  So currently I'm working on roofing my abilities 
      to head copy and become more independent.  Hopefully, I progress enough to participate in the Winter 2019 CW Academy Level 2 course.

      Some practice tools I'm using:
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://morsecode.scphillips.com/trainer.html">Stephen Phillips Mosrse Trainer</a>, a website to learn Morse code.  Based on the lessons of the CW Academy.</li>
        <li><a href="https://lcwo.net/morsemachine">Learn CW Online</a>, a website to learn Morse code.  I've been using the MorseMachine a bit.</li>
        <li><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.niesens.morsetrainer">Claus' Morse Trainer</a>, an android app for practicing Morse code reading.  
          This app doesn't require you to interact with the phone/keyboard during studying.  (Disclaimer, I'm the author of the app.)</li>
        <li> <a href="http://www.dxatlas.com/morserunner/">Morse Runner"</a>Windows program to learn contest exchanges.</li>
      </ul>
