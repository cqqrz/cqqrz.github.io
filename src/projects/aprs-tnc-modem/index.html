    <h3 class="status-on-hold">TNC Modem - APRS with an old smart phone, arduino, and a hand held radio</h3>
    <p>
      I am building a slightly modified version of the Micro Modem by Mark Quist 
      (<a href="http://unsigned.io/projects/micromodem/">http://unsigned.io/projects/micromodem/</a>).
      My goal are to adapt the circuit to be used with an Arduino Nano driving a Baofeng UV-82.  
      Then hookup an old android phone to the tnc modem and use the ARPdroid app to send and receive
      ARPS positions and messages.

    </div>
    <p>
      Pre-build firmware for the atmega328p chip (which the Arduino Nano uses) can be found in at
      <a href="https://github.com/markqvist/MicroAPRS/tree/master/precompiled">https://github.com/markqvist/MicroAPRS/tree/master/precompiled</a>.
      One can also build the firmware
      from source, which is required for Arduino boards with different microprocessors.  In that case 
      check the Makefile and device.h have the desired configuration.

      <strong>Windows OS Notes</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Uploading firmware to the Arduino:</li>
        <dd>Use ArduinoSchetchUploader (<a href="https://github.com/christophediericx/ArduinoSketchUploader">https://github.com/christophediericx/ArduinoSketchUploader</a>)
            to upload the firmware (aka sketch).</dd>          
        <li>Compiling Arduino firmware:</li>
        <dd>Use WinAVR (<a href="http://winavr.sourceforge.net/">http://winavr.sourceforge.net/</a>) 
            to build the firmware from source using <code>make clean all</code> command.</dd>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Current Issues</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Sending ARPS:</li>
        <dd>Sometimes sent ARPS message are not received by my local iGate or other nodes in the neighbourhood. 
            I'm not sure if there is a setup issue or APRS is naturally that flaky.</dd>          
        <li>Receive ARPS message:</li>
        <dd>ARPS messages don't seem to be received.  I'm not sure if that's a hardware or software issue.</dd>
      </ul>
