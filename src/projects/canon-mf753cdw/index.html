      <dt class="status-active">Unscannable Areas / Scan Margins / Cut-off Edges when Scanning</dt>
      <dd><p>For scanning QSL cards and other things I need to be able to scan all the way to the edge of the paper. That's one main reason why I stayed away from purchasing a Brother multi function printer as their scanners do have a 3mm margin. Brother acknowledges this on their help site, just search for "unscannable".</p>
      <p>The first thing I did when I got the MF753Cdw was installing the latest "Master Setup (Windows)" driver from Canon.  Shockingly I noticed that the scanner also crops nearly 3mm on the edges when scanning on the flat bed.<p>

      <p>The multi function driver "[Windows 64bit] MF753Cdw/ MF751Cdw MFDrivers (Generic Plus UFR II / Generic FAX / ScanGear)" also crops the scan as seen below.</p>

      <p>Luckily my daughter setup the printer on another Windows 10 computer and scanned successfully to the edge.  It took me quite a while to determine that it was the Canon driver that are faulty and add this limitation.  The below scan is what any normal consumer would expect.</p>

      <p>The problem now is that with the Microsoft driver the advanced features are lost.
