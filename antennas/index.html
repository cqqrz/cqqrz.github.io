    <h3>Antennas</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>Homemade 10 meter dipole</li>
      <dd>My first dipole antenna.  So far I haven't made any contacts as I only
        get a lot of static on 10 meters.</dd>

      <li>Homemade 20/40/80 meter dipole</li>
      <dd>My first working HF antenna.  The design is a parallel dipole antenna with
        the 80 meter being a folded dipole. The 80 meter wire turned out to be too
        short so only 20 and 40 meters are useful.  Since I shorened the 20 meter
        insulated wire by folding it back on itself I can't use the 20m band when
        the antenna is wet.  The SWR skyrockets.  None the less the 20 and 40 meter
        band work quite well even at the antennas temporary location which is only
        15 foot off the ground.

      <li>RadioWavz 20/40 dipole</li>
      <dd>I got the DP4-2 antenna with my first radio, the Icom IC-7300 from Ham
        Radio Outlet.  It should have been a simple beginners antenna but the SWR
        is way off.  It turns out that the inner wire between the balun and the
        traps is to short for the 20m band.  Not something that's easily corrected.
        Needles to say I haven't used this antenna.</dd>
