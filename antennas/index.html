    <h3>Antennas</h3>
	<p>
	  All antennas are still of a temporay nature.  Because of that the antennas change
	  quite a bit.  So this page gives only an idea of what antenna I'm currently using.

      <dt>Homemade 10 & 20 meter dipole</dt>
      <dd>My first dipole antenna.  I haven't made any contacts as I only got a
        lot of static on 10 meters.  I upgraded the dipole by adding a home made 1:1
		    current balun and added a 20m dipole wire as well.  Since then I have made a
		    contact on 10m and may contacts on 20m.  In fact this is my best 20m antenna which
		    also has gotten me a contact with Cook Island.

        My first working HF antenna.  The design is a parallel dipole antenna with
        the 80 meter being a folded dipole. The 80 meter wire turned out to be too
        short so only 20 and 40 meters are useful.  Since I shorened the 20 meter
        insulated wire by folding it back on itself I can't use the 20m band when
        the antenna is wet.  The SWR skyrockets.  None the less the 20 and 40 meter
        band work quite well even at the antennas temporary location which is only
        15 foot off the ground.

	  <dt>Homemade 10 meter vertical dipole antenna</dt>
	  <dd>Works great for portable operation when mounted on a windsock pole that is being
	    held by a bicycle workstand (my tripod alternative).</dd>

	  <dt>Homemade multiband clothesline reel antenna</dt>
	  <dd>For portable operation, this antenna goes up to 60m.  Still have to use
	    it more to evaluate the antenna.</dd>

	  <dt>TRAM 1185-BNC VHF/UHF magnetic antenna</dt>
	  <dd>For occasional vehicle usage.  The antenna whistles in the wind, yes sometimes
	    it's windy enough here that you hear it even when parked.  Otherwise probably OK,
		although I haven't used it much.</dd>

	  <dt>Tape measure antennas</dt>
	  <dd>I have one for 2m and a cute little one for 70cm.  They work great and get me to
	    the repeater of the neighbouring town without a problem.  I have used both of them
		quite often to join their weekly net.  Haven't had a chance to use them for a fox
		hunt but I'm planning on trying it.</dd>

      <dt>RadioWavz 20/40 dipole</dt>
      <dd>I got the DP4-2 antenna with my first radio, the Icom IC-7300 from Ham
        Radio Outlet.  It should have been a simple beginners antenna but the SWR
        is way off.  It turns out that the inner wire between the balun and the
        traps is to short for the 20m band.  Not something that's easily corrected.
        Needles to say I haven't used this antenna.</dd>
