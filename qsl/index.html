    <h3>QSL</h3>
    <p>
      I upload logs to LOTW, eQSL and QRZ.<br>
      <i>(logs may take 24h to be uploaded)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
     Let me know if you want an QSL card, as I don't mail them by default.

	    Special card for my first DX contact.  My daughter is pointing out the 20m dipole antenna she build with me.
		That evening I talked (phone) to E51DLD from Cook Islands with it.  Pretty awsome.

	    My current QSL card. I asked my daughter to draw a picture for my QSL card.  I guess she was a bit inspried
		by the first one. *smile*
